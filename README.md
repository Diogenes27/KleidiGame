# KleidiGame
A simple unix-style command-line game about hacking. 


After pressing run, resize console window height so "KLEIDI" is barely visible.

The game is designed to be run in a 25 high by 80 wide terminal window. Please resize terminal window accordingly.

It's ok if the window is a little larger, but a window smaller than 25x80 may cause some issues.
